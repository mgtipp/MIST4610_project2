## Dataset Description and Contents
The chosen dataset contains information on the most popular songs worldwide on Spotify by year from 2010-2019. The data was sourced from Billboard, the leading organization for music charting and ranking, and posted to the website [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year). The dataset contains one csv file called top10s.csv and is comprised of 603 rows and 15 columns. 
<br><br>
The first column is a primary key simply identifying the index for a given track. The second, third, and fourth columns are of type VARCHAR and describe the song title, artist name, and genre, respectively. The fifth column specifies the year that the given track appeared on the Billboard. The rest of the columns are integer attributes describing the sound of the song: bpm (beats per minute - tempo of the song), nrgy (energy - the higher the value, the more energetic), dnce (dance - the higher the value, the easier it is to dance to), dB (decibel - loudness), live (liveliness - the higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording), val (valence - the higher the value, the more positive mood), dur (duration in seconds), acous (acousticness - the higher the value, the more acoustic), spch (speechiness - the higher the value, the more spoken word the song contains), and pop (popularity - the higher the value, the more popular the song). Using this data, we can analyze certain questions.
