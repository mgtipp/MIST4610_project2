## Dataset Description and Contents
The chosen dataset contains information on the 100 most popular songs worldwide on Spotify by year from 1921-2020. The data was sourced from Spotify Web API and posted to the website [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ektanegi/spotifydata-19212020). The dataset contains one csv file called data.csv and is comprised of 169909 rows and 19 columns. 
<br><br>
9 columns are of decimal type, 6 are of integer type, and 4 are of type String. The primary key identifies a given track with the ID of the track generated by Spotify. Acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence, liveness, and speechiness range from 0 to 1 describing the named characteristics of the track. Duration_ms is an integer column that ranges from 200k to 300k. Popularity ranges from 0 to 100, tempo ranges from 50 to 150, loudness ranges from -60 to 0, and year ranges from 1921 to 2020. Two attributes, mode and explicit, have a value of either 0 or 1 to specify whether the track is in a minor/major key and explicit/not explicit. The key attribute ranges from 0-11 starting on C as 0, C# as 1, and so on. Another attribute lists the name(s) of the artists, release_date names the date of release in yyyy-mm-dd format, and the name attribute lists the name of the song. Using this data, we can analyze certain questions.
