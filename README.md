## Dataset Description and Contents
The chosen dataset contains information on the most popular songs worldwide on Spotify by year from 2010-2019. The data was sourced from Billboard, the leading organization for music charting and ranking, and posted to the website [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year). The dataset contains one csv file called top10s.csv and is comprised of 603 rows and 15 columns. 
<br><br>
The first column is a primary key simply identifying the row number for a given song. The second, third, and fourth columns are of type VARCHAR and describe the song title, artist name, and top genre classified, respectively. The fifth column specifies the year that the given song was released. The rest of the columns are integer attributes describing the sound of the song: beats per minute (bpm/speed of song), nrgy (?), dnce (?), dB (?), liveliness (live), valence (val), duration in seconds (dur), acousticness (acous), speechiness (spch), and pop (?). Using this data, we can analyze certain questions.
